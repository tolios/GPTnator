# GPTnator

## Project aim
A small project trying to replicate the known akinator: https://en.akinator.com/ app, using prompt engineering with advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT.

## How to
Simply copy the initialization prompt from the gptnator_prompt.txt and paste it on ChatGPT website: https://chat.openai.com/auth/login

For the GPTnator to have any hope, please use only recommended responses:
* yes
* no
* don't know
* probably
* probably not

## Limitations

A lot, but the most pernicious which we identified and tried to remedy is that after a while it might get stuck asking the same questions.

CURRENTLY ONLY USE FOR FAMOUS PEOPLE (probably very famous at that)...

## Ideas

Always open to new ideas and suggestions. Could we perhaps develop a metric to decide which init prompt might be better? Could we guess also other things like objects or animals?

### How the idea popped up?

A late night we were playing with ChatGPT (as you do) and came up with the problem so... TADA ...
