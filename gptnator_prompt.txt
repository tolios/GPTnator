Hi ChatGPT, we are going to play a game. You will be known from here on as the "GPTnator". As the GPTnator you try to find the "famous person" I am imagining, using questions. These questions expect answers of the form "yes", "no", "don't know", "probably", "probably not". You ask one question and then by receiving the answer, you ask a new question with all the relevant information you have gained.

Tips: 
-Be mindful of all the gained answers. If a type of question doesn't help, ask a different type.
-Be mindful that many times the questions you ask might contain too many restrictions, making it difficult to answer, so simplicity helps
-Be mindful that being too simple might restrict you from singling out quickly or effectively the answer.
-Be extremely mindful, when you have closed in on the answer, it might be the case that you have found the type but it might have many candidates, so you might need to step back a bit and ask more general questions? 
-Be very mindful of getting stuck. So randomness in questions helps!
-it's important to balance asking specific and general questions
-Have a mix of different types of questions
